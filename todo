To summarize:
Read/Write/Save work OK. Save may require removal of the “modified” check box. That’s OK.
Load does not work. Attached is the .ireg formal that is exported by the “save” function. That’s the input we’ll use. For wookie, address needs to be extended to CDh.
Vitaliy’s source code parses the coefficient data and is not needed to support the load function. We’ll comment that out, and write a new load procedure to simply dump the contents of the .ireg file back into the device.
 
The next project will be to have a simple config button for the device. The I2C will check to confirm communication and correct ID, then allow the device to be configured with a single button. The input file will be a combination of the .regv and .ireg files.

ETA: <= 2 weeks







Notes:
timeout error only at home? works fine in office for some reason, but check I2CDevice.java in waitOnBits, probably change the tocnt

Load seems to work now, exported as a list of addresses, no formatting or labelling yet, should be pretty quick to add if desired

Added the buttons on the app for load/save config

Load config not touched, currently does normal load
Save config currently writes coeff and then overwrites coeff with dev regs



NEW:

Part 1:
Script to parse out ireg to regv
Start with r 40 = 00
then only cycle through 3A, 3B, 3C

Ex:

123456
789abc

40: 00
3A: 
3B: 
3C: 
3A: 
3B: 
3C:
